## < PersonaAnalyst is a multimodal AI agent that helps users understand and communicate more effectively with others by combining public data and meeting audio analysis. It starts by generating a personality profile using the person’s name — pulling real-time data from platforms like LinkedIn and Twitter via SerpAPI, then summarizing key traits and communication tips using Gemini 2.0. Users can then upload an audio recording (e.g. from Google Meet), which is transcribed with Whisper and analyzed for tone, topics, key quotes, and behavioral cues. All insights are merged into the profile, making it smarter over time. Finally, users can chat with an AI assistant that offers strategic advice on how to collaborate, negotiate, or build rapport with the person — just like a real communication coach. >
